Sure — here’s a clean and editable `README.md` file you can include in your repo to explain its purpose, structure, usage, and how to test it with GitLens:

---

## 📜 `README.md`

```markdown
# Simple GitLens Test Repository

## 📖 Description

This is a simple Python project created to test and demonstrate the functionality of the **GitLens extension** in Visual Studio Code. It contains a couple of basic mathematical functions and is tracked with Git to allow inspection of code history, authorship, and commit details using GitLens.

## 📁 Project Structure

```

simple-gitlens-repo/
│
├── main.py               # Python file containing two simple functions
├── README.md             # Project description and instructions
└── gitlens\_insights.md   # Documentation of GitLens insights (to be created)

````

## 📜 Files and Functions

- **main.py**
  - `calculate_sum(a, b)` → Returns the sum of two numbers.
  - `multiply_numbers(x, y)` → Returns the product of two numbers.

## 🚀 How to Test with GitLens

1. **Install GitLens**  
   Open Visual Studio Code → Extensions (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) → Search for `GitLens` → Install.

2. **Clone This Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd simple-gitlens-repo
   code .
````

3. **Inspect Function History**

   * Open `main.py`
   * Click on the line number beside a function definition.
   * Hover to view the inline blame (author, date, commit).
   * Right-click the line → `GitLens: Show Line History` to see commit history for that line.

4. **Edit and Commit Changes**

   * Modify one of the functions.
   * Commit the change.
   * Re-inspect with GitLens to observe updated history.

## 📄 gitlens\_insights.md

Use this file to document:

* Who authored a function
* When it was last updated
* Which commit introduced it

Example:

```
## Function: calculate_sum

- Author: Sai Chaithanya Poloju
- First Added In Commit: e9f84c2 - "Initial commit with calculate_sum and multiply_numbers"
- Last Modified In Commit: b47a53e - "Refactored calculate_sum for float support"
```

## 📌 License

Open source — feel free to modify and test as needed.

✅ You can directly copy this into your `README.md` — it’s clean, testable, and explains everything your repo does with instructions to edit, commit, and check with GitLens.  

Would you like me to generate a `gitlens_insights.md` sample file too?
